\section{Implementation of $m_W$-filtered $W+$jets sample}


To improve statistics of $W+$jets component in signal region, the $m_W$-filtered $W+$jets samples are used, which the samples are generated in $m_W^{\mathrm{born}}>105$~GeV only. The strategy is to combine the inclusive $W+$jets sample in $m_W^{\mathrm{born}}<105$~GeV region with the filtered sample to improve the statistics in high born mass region. FIG.~\ref{fig:bornmass} shows the comparison on the born mass between the inclusive $W+$jets sample and $m_W$-filtered sample. They are consistent in $m_W>105$~GeV region.

After combining two samples, FIG.~\ref{fig:lepjetmass_inc_mwfilter} shows the comparison on the invariant mass of lepton and jet distribution between the inclusive sample and combined sample in electron and muon channel. However, the statistical uncertainty of the combined sample is not obviously smaller than the inclusive one in both electron and muon channel. To cross check the conclusion, FIG.~\ref{fig:lepjetmass_highmass_mwfilter} shows the same comparison in $m_W>105$~GeV region. The expected strong improvement from combined sample is not happened. This is due to the generated number of events of the $m_W$-filtered sample is not very large. As a result, combining with the $m_W$-filtered sample cannot have large improvement on the statistics of $W+$jets sample.
