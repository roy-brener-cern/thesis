The ATLAS detector at the LHC has been used to search for new phenomena in the lepton+jet invariant mass spectrum. 
The search is performed with $165~\textrm{fb}^{-1}$ at $\sqrt{s}=13.6~\textrm{TeV}$ recoded during 2022--2024. The observed invariant mass spectrum of lepton+jet pairs is consistent with SM expectations. Upper exclusion limits are set on the cross section times branching fraction for quantum black holes decaying to a lepton and a quark in a search region with invariant mass above 3.0~TeV. The
resulting lower mass threshold limits in the ADD (RS1) models with six, four and two (one) extra dimensions at the 95\%
C.L. The obtained limits show a factor of \textcolor{blue}{complete} improvement with respect to the previous model-independent upper limit on $\sigma \times BR$~\cite{ATLAS:2023vat}. The obtained limit on the QBH threshold mass for the
ADD, RS model is \textcolor{blue}{complete, complete} TeV higher compared to the previous ATLAS result in this channel at 13.0~TeV~\cite{ATLAS:2023vat}, respectively.
