\section{Executive Summary}
A summary of key analysis points is given below
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Physics target}: search for signatures of QBHs in electron+jet and muon+jet final states.
    \item \textbf{Observable}: invariant mass of the lepton-jet system, $m_{\ell j}$; statistical analysis in bins of $m_{\ell j}$.
    \item \textbf{Strategy}: signal and background are estimated from MC using a set of event generators. In the $e+j$ channel, the non-prompt/multijet (``fake'' electrons) background is estimated using a data-driven approach. The search is performed in a wide signal region starting at 3~TeV, with QBH threshold mass range of 6--10.5~TeV.

    \item \textbf{Collision dataset}: Run3 data collected by ATLAS between 2022--2024 at $\sqrt{s} = 13.6~\textrm{TeV}$ with $165.4~\textrm{fb}^{-1}$.

\end{itemize}
