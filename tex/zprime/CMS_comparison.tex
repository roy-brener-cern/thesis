In late 2023, CMS published \cite{CMS_Zprimebb} a direct search for $\Zp$ resonances in dimuon final states in association with $b$-jets, where the signal was based on the $B_{3}-L_{2}$ model. A requirement set on the minimum invariant mass of any muon-$b$-jet pairing, $\textrm{min}(m_{\mu b})>175\;\textrm{GeV}$, reduced most of the $t\bar{t}$ background remaining following the $b$-jet selection to be at least one. Results were also interpreted in a flavour-universal context and exclusion limits were set on the $\Zp$ coupling to $b$-quarks and leptons. For the specific case of the $B_{3}-L_{2}$ model, $350 < m_{\Zp} < 500 \; \textrm{GeV}$ were excluded for most allowed parameter space, in terms of $\Zp$ couplings to fermions. CMS did not include a zero-$b$-jet category in their analysis.

The limits set by CMS are on the number of signal events at 95\% CL. In order to compare, a test-case is chosen using the dimuon channel.
